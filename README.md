# Stardust rebuilt

This little project tries to recover a reasonable version of the source code
for our game Stardust, to celebrate the 30 years since its original release
back in 1987.

I have focused on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum version of the game. We ported it
to the Amstrad CPC, while other people did the MSX, C-64 and eventual PC
versions. But my nostalgia starts and ends with the Spectrum.

## How was this done?

I downloaded a few Spectrum emulators since I didn't know which were best
and what they could do. I settled on Fuse and its toolset. Next was an image
of the tape from the original Spanish release. I ran the tape in the emulator
and waited for the game to load. It does a little intro and credits sequence,
which I didn't bother to capture. Once the game was in the main menu, I
grabbed a snapshot in z80 format, and worked from there.

- Capture a profile of the game running, and generate a map file that will
contain the code sections that have been executed. This should include most
code, and hopefully lead to an almost-ready-to-assemble source file.
- Use SkoolKit with the snapshot and the map file, to create a control file
that contains information on the snapshot memory map: code and data sections,
mainly.

Now we iterate on this point as many times as needed (a lot) to improve
the control file and reach a very complete assembly file.

- Generate an assembly source file from the snapshot and the control file
- Study the assembly code and iterate on the control file to add more
information: labels, comments, better delineation of data sections, etc.

At any point, with the assembly file in a good state, we can generate an executable.

- Assemble the source code into a binary, and convert it to snapshot format,
with a valid stack pointer and entry point. Note the original snapshot was
captured in the middle of the game running, but I wanted a reasonable
entry point that sets everything up.
- Tweak the snapshot to set the border color and disable interrupts.
- At this point we have a valid snapshot that can be loaded and runs fine.

I work on a Windows machine, so I have documented the commands to run the
above steps inside the file [b.cmd](b.cmd). Adapt the paths in that file to
your own installation if you want to use run it yourself.

## Tools

- *SkoolKit*: [http://skoolkit.ca/](http://skoolkit.ca/) Note: requires Python 3.4+
- *Fuse - The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator*: [http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/) Don't worry, it's been ported to many operating systems besides Unix.
- *SjAsmPlus*: [https://github.com/mkoloberdin/sjasmplus](https://github.com/mkoloberdin/sjasmplus)
